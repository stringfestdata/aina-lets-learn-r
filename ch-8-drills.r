# - Drop the `name` column
# - Create a `weight_kg` column (weight * .454)
# - Sort by `mpg` by low to high
# - Keep only the records with `cylinder` of more than 4
# - Get the average `mpg` for each `origin`
# 

# Pick a `seaborn` dataset or two... and make some visualizations!
# 
# Include at least two univariate and two bivariate plots. 
# Label your axes and titles on at least one of them.
